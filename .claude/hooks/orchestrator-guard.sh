# description: Block non-orchestrator write/edit/bash calls when orchestrator.strict=true; also block direct git mutations in non-strict mode
# enabled_by_default: true

# This hook is always active (enabled_by_default: true).
# It self-checks whether orchestrator.strict mode is enabled in project.yaml.
# If strict mode is off, the hook exits 0 immediately and imposes no overhead.
#
# Only mutating tools (Write, Edit, Bash) are intercepted.
# Research tools (read, glob, grep) are never blocked.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = allow, 2 = block.
#
# On exit 2 the harness feeds *stderr* back to the model as the block reason
# and ignores stdout. Writing the guard message to stdout (as versions <=2.1.0
# did) therefore surfaced a bare "hook error: No stderr output" instead of the
# explanation — the block worked, the reason was lost (issue #396). Every
# message emitted on a blocking path must go to stderr.
#
# Identity note (see agent-meta issue #390): no provider's PreToolUse hook
# payload identifies which subagent issued the call — Claude Code's
# documented payload is {session_id, transcript_path, hook_event_name,
# tool_name, tool_input} only, with no agent/subagent field. The only
# channel a hook can read without corrupting tool semantics is the `Bash`
# `command` string itself. Authorized delegates (git, orchestrator agent
# templates) therefore self-declare by prefixing every Bash command with a
# sentinel comment line: `#agent-meta:agent=<name>`. This is a soft,
# self-reported convention (matches the framework's existing A2A trust
# model, see .claude/rules/a2a-delegation-gates.md) — it is not a security
# boundary against a malicious agent, only a fix for the identification gap.
# Write/Edit have no such safe channel (a marker would corrupt file
# content), so they are never exempted under strict mode.
#
# Hardening (issue #516): a real-world incident showed a non-git worker
# self-declaring as `git` via this sentinel to run destructive stash
# operations. Elevation is therefore capability-scoped and audited:
#   * `orchestrator` sentinel exempts ONLY from strict-mode main-chat
#     blocking (Bash) — it NEVER bypasses the git-mutation block.
#   * `git` sentinel exempts ONLY from the git-mutation block.
#   * Destructive operations (force push, reset --hard, clean -f, stash
#     drop/clear, filter-branch/filter-repo, working-tree wipe) are
#     blocked EVEN with a valid `git` sentinel and require the user to
#     approve/run them manually.
#   * Every elevation attempt is appended to .claude/hooks/.guard-audit.log
#     for post-hoc review.
# Identity itself remains unverifiable at hook level (provider payload has
# no agent field) — this is mitigation, not cryptographic trust; see
# .claude/rules/a2a-delegation-gates.md ("Bekannte Grenzen").
